# Urho3D Skinned Armor and Melee Combat
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This sample contains implementation of skinned armor to a character as a geometry. Alternative is to add it as AnimatedModel which would 
require performing the entire skeleton's bone matrix multiplication per AnimatedModel.  

Melee combat was also added.  Animations took a while to complete and is still not perfect but it was the best that I could do as a programmer.
